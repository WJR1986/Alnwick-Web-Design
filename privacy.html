            <h4>2. What Does This Policy Cover?</h4>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to your use of Our Site. Our Site may contain links to other websites.
                Please note that we have no control over how your data is collected, stored, or used by other websites,
                and we advise you to check the privacy policies of any such websites before providing any data to them.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>3. What is Personal Data?</h4>
            <p>Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (the “GDPR”)
                as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in
                particular by reference to an identifier’. Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you
                that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and
                contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic
                location data, and other online identifiers.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>4. What Are My Rights?</h4>
            <p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights, which we will always work to uphold:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The right to be informed about our collection and use of your personal data. This Privacy Policy
                    should tell you everything you need to know, but you can always contact us to find out more or to
                    ask any questions using the details in Part 10.</li>
                <li>The right to access the personal data we hold about you. Part 9 will tell you how to do this.</li>
                <li>The right to have your personal data rectified if any of your personal data held by us is inaccurate
                    or incomplete. Please contact us using the details in Part 10 to find out more.</li>
                <li>The right to be forgotten, i.e. the right to ask us to delete or otherwise dispose of any of your
                    personal data that we have. Please contact us using the details in Part 10 to find out more.</li>
                <li>The right to restrict (i.e. prevent) the processing of your personal data.</li>
                <li>The right to object to us using your personal data for a particular purpose or purposes.</li>
                <li>The right to data portability. This means that, if you have provided personal data to us directly,
                    we are using it with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed
                    using automated means, you can ask us for a copy of that personal data to re-use with another
                    service or business in many cases.</li>
                <li>Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling. We do not use your personal data in this
                    way. For more information about our use of your personal data or exercising your rights as outlined
                    above, please contact us using the details provided in Part 10. Further information about your
                    rights can also be obtained from the Information Commissioner’s Office or your local Citizens Advice
                    Bureau. If you have any cause for complaint about our use of your personal data, you have the right
                    to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h4>5. What Personal Data Do You Collect?</h4>
            <p>Subject to the following, we do not collect any personal data from you. We do not place cookies on your
                computer or device, nor do we use any other means of data collection. If you send us an email, we may
                collect your name, your email address, and any other information which you choose to give us.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>6. How Do You Use My Personal Data?</h4>
            <p>If we do collect any personal data, it will be processed and stored securely, for no longer than is
                necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. We will comply with our
                obligations and safeguard your rights under the GDPR at all times. For more details on security see Part
                7, below. As stated above, we do not generally collect any personal data. If you contact us and we
                obtain your personal details from your email, we may use them to respond to your email. Any and all
                emails containing your personal data will be deleted no later than 1 month after the subject matter of
                your email has been resolved. You have the right to withdraw your consent to us using your personal data
                at any time, and to request that we delete it.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>7. How and Where Do You Store My Data?</h4>
            <p>We will only store your personal data in the UK. This means that it will be fully protected under the
                GDPR.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>8. Do You Share My Personal Data?</h4>
            <p>We will not share any of your personal data with any third parties for any purposes, subject to one
                important exception. In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain personal
                data, which might include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal
                obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>9. How Can I Access My Personal Data?</h4>
            <p>If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal
                data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access
                request”. All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal
                addresses shown in Part 10. To make this as easy as possible for you, a Subject Access Request Form is
                available for you to use. You do not have to use this form, but it is the easiest way to tell us
                everything we need to know to respond to your request as quickly as possible. There is not normally any
                charge for a subject access request. If your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for
                example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in
                responding. We will respond to your subject access request within 1 month and, in any case, not more
                than one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of
                your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more
                complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your
                request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>10. How Do I Contact You?</h4>
            <p>To contact us about anything to do with your personal data and data protection, including to make a
                subject access request, please use the following details (for the attention of Alnwick Web Design):</p>

            <h4>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>We may change this Privacy Notice from time to time. This may be necessary, for example, if the law
                changes, or if we change our business in a way that affects personal data protection. Any changes will
                be immediately posted on Our Site and you will be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Privacy
                Policy on your first use of Our Site following the alterations. We recommend that you check this page
